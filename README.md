## Hello! üëã

My name's Hanyuan, and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of New South Wales. I'm most skilled at frontend development (specifically [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)), but I am interested in other things, including [messing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) [with](https://factorcode.org/) [programming](https://crystal-lang.org/) [languages](https://clojure.org/) and game development.

## What I do üë®‚Äçüíª

Most of my work on GitHub is for student societies in UNSW. Specifically:

- I was a Development Executive for [CSESoc](https://github.com/csesoc), which meant I helped overlook the various software projects we develop.
- Before that, I was a Competitions director for CSESoc - check out their website [here](https://www.csesoc.unsw.edu.au)!
- I was a member of the Projects subcommittee in CSESoc, where I helped make the [content management system for articles](https://github.com/csesoc/cms.csesoc.unsw.edu.au).
- I was the IT director for [Co-op Soc](https://github.com/coopsoc), where I helped maintain the [website](https://coopsoc.com.au).

## My interests üöÄ

Below are some of the things I've done:

- I've made a little [Minecraft mod](https://github.com/hanyuone/Checkpoint) to teach myself some Java.
- I've made [some](https://github.com/hanyuone/beautifier) [small](https://github.com/hanyuone/clojure-webapp) [things](https://github.com/hanyuone/aoc-2021) in Clojure, and I'm always looking for ways I can shove it into a project (it'll simplify state in React guys, trust me!)
- I've experimented with making [programming languages](https://github.com/hanyuone/pancake), but I hope to eventually make a programming language wtih syntax highlighting and proper tooling.
